The main idea of this talk was: there are different methods of corporate education. And you should choose wisely.
These methods include [audits](https://wemake.services/meta/rsdp/audits/) and [corporate consulting](https://drylabs.io).

I also discussed why online courses do not work and what problems other platforms have.

There are no videos yet, but here's the [online translation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J65mOFXTpNc).
