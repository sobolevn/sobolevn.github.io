You often can see lists of awesome apps that you are not going to use or ones that just do not fit you.

This one is different. This list contains simple, yet very powerful productivity boosters that totally fits everyone.


**TLDR**: Here's the list of all mac apps I am using, they can be found in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/sobolevn/dotfiles/blob/master/Brewfile#L126-L164) with the rest of my setup.

## Dato

That's a new project from [@sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus). It is simple, yet amazing.
For some reason, traditional mac clocks do not show dates and calendar.
So, when someone asks you what date is it today you have to open a calendar app. Seriously?

This app solves it. It is just an improved clock with calendar and timezones.

This is a new app, it was just announced:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="ru"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Announcing my latest Mac app:<br>Dato—A better menu bar clock with calendar and time zones.<a href="https://t.co/Div5ozziJb">https://t.co/Div5ozziJb</a> <a href="https://t.co/xRPutTfDkt">pic.twitter.com/xRPutTfDkt</a></p>&mdash; Sindre Sorhus (@sindresorhus) <a href="https://twitter.com/sindresorhus/status/1150475307301974016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">14 июля 2019 г.</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


You might also want to hide the original clock from your status bar. That's how it can be [done](https://appsliced.co/ask/how-do-i-hide-the-clock-from-my-menu-bar-in-os-x).

## HazeOver

The next app allows highlighting the currently focused window. It sounds not like much, but the feel from this app is amazing. It works great for both light and dark background. Watch this:

Looks awesome, doesn't it?

## OpenInTerminal-Lite

When traveling around your files in Finder you might need to open the current folder inside your Terminal. You can drag-and-drop it to the terminal (which many users do not like) or you can use [OpenInTerminal-Lite](https://github.com/Ji4n1ng/OpenInTerminal).

It adds new icons to your Finder to open anything inside your Terminal or Editor with a single click:

## Spectacle

[Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) allows using keyboard shortcuts to reorganize windows on your desktop.

It is a life-saver for people who have a lot of opened windows and complex workflows. Do you want to have an IDE opened next to your browser? Two key presses. Do you want your terminals sorted? Two key presses.

As simple as that.

## Previews

That's a whole set of different Quick Preview plugins in [this wonderful repo](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-look-plugins).

They do amazing things to your Quick Preview, like:

- Highlights your code

- Allows to view image sizes

- Highlights, pretty-prints, and transforms `json`

## Flux

Should I really mention Flux? Because everyone should already have one installed.

Flux turns your monitor colors to be warm at night. This allows your eyes and brain to rest. [Use it!](https://justgetflux.com/)

And you can try the demo [look-and-feel online](https://fluxometer.com/rainbow).

What apps do you use? What problems do they solve?
