If you want to invite me to a conference, I would be happy to participate.

If it is a free community event – I will speak there for free, except the travel compensation.
If it is a paid conference / company organized free event – my price is 200.000 rubles for a talk.

What's included?
- All the travel consts
- Styling the presentation into any template you wish
- Custom talk ideas
- Controlling the preparation process from the client
- All the paperwork

Paid conference talks is one of the main way that allow me to keep producing high quality opensource libraries and free educational content.
