I am Nikita Sobolev (Russian: Никита Соболев).
This is how I usually look like:

## Work

I work as a CTO at [wemake.services](https://wemake-services.github.io),
I also happen to be a founder of this company.

The thing I like about my job is freedom, I can:
- Create new products for our clients
- Write a lot of [open-source code](https://github.com/sobolevn) [:star:](https://stars.github.com/profiles/sobolevn/)
- Work on processes in our company, that's exactly how I came up with [`RSDP`](https://wemake-services.github.io/meta/)
- Spread a word about what I do with my [blog posts](https://sobolevn.me/) and [conference talks](https://sobolevn.me/talks/)
- Participate in different closely-related [activities](https://sobolevn.me/activities/)

### Side projects

I also run a few side projects:

- [hrvs.tech](https://hrvs.tech/) where I help recruiters to write great vacancies for developers (**closed**)
- [drylabs.io](https://drylabs.tilda.ws) where I consult people about their architecture and design decisions. This project is started with sustainable open-source model in mind
- [OpensourceFindings](https://t.me/opensource_findings) channel where I share and advertise awesome open-source related projects, articles, and talks


## Stack

I work with `python`, `elixir`, and `javascript` (`typescript` too).
But, I am also familiar with *many* other languages.

You can check my [`.dotfiles`](https://github.com/sobolevn/dotfiles) to get
the exact the same setup as I have.


## Conferences I organize

I am also helping to organize several meetups and conferences:

- [ElixirLangMoscow](http://elixir-lang.moscow/) which I founded back in 2016
- [MoscowPythonConf](http://conf.python.ru) where I am a Program Committee member
- [RussianPythonWeek](https://conf.python.ru/moscow/2020) where I am a Program Committee leader


## Education career

I also like to spread the limited knowledge I have.
I gave lectures in several Universities in Russia:

- [MosPolytech](https://mospolytech.ru/) in 2017
- [RANEPA](https://www.ranepa.ru/) in 2018
- [IFMO](http://www.ifmo.ru/) in 2019
- [SPbU](https://spbu.ru/) in 2020/2021

And I have also created several
independent courses for `#tceh`, `iidf`, `devman`, and `Numa Moscow`.

I have also participated in
[Google Summer of Code 2020](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2020/may/13/summer-of-code/)
as a mentor for Django Software Foundation.
